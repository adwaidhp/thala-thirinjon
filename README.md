### Project Description

"Ee extension mala marakkum"
    A chaotic Chrome extension that turns any webpage into a playground of pranks ‚Äî with roasts, DOM mischief, Gen-Z slang, fake modals, and unhinged keyboard shortcuts.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Coding and browsing the web are too normal. People just scroll calmly, read things, click buttons...
Where's the fun, the chaos, the mind-melting madness? Problems that seemed not to exist:

1. People are not talking in genz language in official emails
2. Not browsing the web updside down.
3. People are using qwerty too much. ABCD alphabetical order is not given enough attention
4. Not getting roasted for their mistakes.
5. Esc button not giving realistic escape from the web.
6. Lack of bombs to blow up one's screen content.
7. Warns about future life decisions (Joining B.Tech).


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We are solving it in the most useless way possible. Users can solve all of the above (non-existent) problems by downloading our web extension. 
1. Ctrl + P: Translates proffesional english to broken language as a mix of hindi and english while using genz terms.
2. Ctrl + R: Rotates the whole webpage by 180 degrees.
3. Ctrl + U: Switches QWERTY keyboard to ABCDE keyboard, confusing the user.
4. Ctrl + C: Roasts user in malayalam for copy pasting too much.
   Ctrl + Z: Trolls user for being clumsy.
5. Esc: Fades the current website away from reality forever.
6. Ctrl + S: Blows up the screen.
7. Searching for terms like "ktu", "btech", "CSE" might end up in a warning!!
